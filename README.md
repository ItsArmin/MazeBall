A Unity3D puzzle game made for Oculus Rift.

## Summary
Made as a final project for a VR class in Spring 2017 as a student at the University of Illinois. This repo will mainly be an overview the project itself and how it works. *(Note: As of Dec. 2018, will try to add some of the codebase here, but ulitmately the project is large and designed for school, so may not be able to put too much here)*

## Background
Throughout the VR Class at the U of I, assignments and lectures all focused on various parts of VR as a whole: generalized topics like 3D vector match and computer graphics, along with more applied subjects like Unity3D development and VR experience strategies (i.e. how to reduce motion sickness, better create immersion through UX, etc.). This all culminated in building some sort of Unity3D-based experience for Oculus Rift (note: the reason for the class using Oculus Rift is that my professor, Steve LaValle, was one of the scientists at Oculus in its first few years as a company).

As a fan of video games, especially Nintendo-made ones, I pushed for making a game as the project. One thing I personally noticed with most VR experiences was that many of them aimed for immersion via a first-person view, which in some cases can work well, but if not done cleverly, can either eliminate immersion or cause motion sickness.

Unlike traditional game consoles, creating a first-person action game like *Doom* isn't that straightfoward to move to VR, and simply letting the POV go through the headset while still controlling movement with a typical gamepad causes a sort of mismatch for the brain (since it sees movement, but isn't actually feeling movement), which usually causes motion sickness. One example of the opposite effect was a VR chess game, which was basically just sitting in a chair playing chess and ended up being more immersive since I was playing sitting down (yes, as silly as that may sound, a simple idea ended up being pretty clever for VR).

Our group's idea was to look towards using a more unique control schema or method of immersion, and that idea came originally from this game:

.... to be continued.
